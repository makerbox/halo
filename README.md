- Local https://localwp.com/

## Installation
<p>:point_up: get all the requirements</p>
<p>‚úåÔ∏è fork into your new project</p>
<p>‚ú® create a new site with Local</p>
<p>üëØ "clone" into the app/public directory by adding the remote, fetching, then pulling (regular cloning won't work) see the git section below if you need further detail</p>
<p>:ok_hand: run `npm install`</p>
<p>:metal: change the theme to LaunchCore Child</p>

## Git
The repo only contains the theme files and plugin files. Everything else is generated by Local.
After generating a Local site, navigate to its app/public directory and run `git init`.
This will initialize the local repository for you.
Make sure you have a forked version of LaunchCore. This will ensure you don't accidentally do anything to the source.
Once done, run `git remote add origin [your forked repo URL]` to add the LaunchCore git repo as a remote.
After your remote is set up, you can simply run `git fetch` and then `git pull` to get LaunchCore :)

## Core competencies
- As we build more components etc, this list will grow.

## Preferred plugins
- Check this list before using a plugin.
- Add / edit this list when using a new or better plugin.
- Avoid plugins altogether wherever possible - preferably write new plugins to avoid 3rd party code.

## Use
<ul>
<li><b>Please read the LaunchCore Wiki before use</b></li>
<li>Fork into a new project before using. Never work with the master repo.</li>
<li>You'll know you're ready to go when you see something similar to this:
<img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dgmk5xxwf/image/upload/v1563147557/Capture_dfahij.png" width="300" style="width: 300px; height: auto; display: block"> it indicates wepback is watching your code for changes</li>
<li>LaunchCore will watch your SCSS and JS for changes, then bundle it all together. This applies to both the LaunchCore child theme and the LaunchCore parent theme (which you shouldn't be editing unless adding a new core component).</li>
<li>You won't have to worry about vendor prefixes in your SCSS. LaunchCore incorporates autoprefixer! :)</li>
<li>Be sure to follow the naming conventions and directory structure outlined in the Wiki. This is important for other developers to be able to navigate your work efficiently.</li>
<li>If you build new core components, add them to the Launchcore parent theme and make a pull request on the master repo. Be sure to update this readme with the new competencies, version, and date.</li>
</ul>

## Deployment
Local give you the ability to push and pull from WP Engine with extreme ease. If this is what you need to do, just follow the Local + WP Engine instructions.
If you are deploying to a different host (e.g. Digital Ocean) you'll need to migrate the theme files, plugin files, and database. Local uses Adminer for database access. You can export the database from there, then import into the target database with whatever front end your target uses e.g. phpmyadmin. Once imported, you'll need to change the URLs in the wp_options table to reflect the new location.
If you have command line access such as in the case of Digital Ocean servers, you can set up a fresh WordPress installation on the server, then just initialize a repository, add the remote, etc just like you did in the local installation. You'll still need to export and import the database, but for code changes it is much faster to push to your git repo from local, then pull to your deployment server. It will also help keep track of changes.

## Important notes
ALWAYS follow the coding standards outlined in the LaunchCore project Wiki. Primarily:
- Code with the next developer in mind
- Write decoupled, modular components
- Comment and document thoroughly

## Troubleshooting
- `npm install` failing? You may have an old version of node. For Windows users, follow these steps: https://github.com/felixrieseberg/npm-windows-upgrade. Mac users, just bang in this command: `brew update && brew upgrade node && npm update -g npm`.
- If all else fails, ask the LaunchCore slack channel.
