	<p>
		<i>An evolving, collaborative framework for Five by Five WordPress project development.</i>
	</p>
	<h4>
		A few house rules:
	</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Take your shoes off.
		</li>
		<li>
			Always do your development in the LaunchCore-child theme.
		</li>
		<li>
			If you have components or improvements that you would like to add to the master, put them in the LaunchCore parent theme and make a pull request.
		</li>
		<li>
			Be sure to build blocks on plugins, so they are theme agnostic.
		</li>
		<li>
			If you have any questions:
			<ul>
				<li>
					Read <a href="http://167.71.139.84/">the handbook</a>
				</li>
				<li>
					Check <a href="https://gitlab.dev.fivebyfiveuk.com/internal/launchcore/wikis/home">the LaunchCore wiki</a>
				</li>
				<li>
					Ask the LaunchCore Slack channel
				</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		<strong>
			Most of all: <i>always code with the next developer in mind</i>
